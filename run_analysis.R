### 1. Create the data set of training and test
#Reading training tables - xtrain / ytrain, subject train
xtrain = read.table(file.path(pathdata, "train", "X_train.txt"),header = FALSE)
ytrain = read.table(file.path(pathdata, "train", "y_train.txt"),header = FALSE)
subject_train = read.table(file.path(pathdata, "train", "subject_train.txt"),header = FALSE)

#Reading the testing tables
xtest = read.table(file.path(pathdata, "test", "X_test.txt"),header = FALSE)
ytest = read.table(file.path(pathdata, "test", "y_test.txt"),header = FALSE)
subject_test = read.table(file.path(pathdata, "test", "subject_test.txt"),header = FALSE)

#Read the features data
features = read.table(file.path(pathdata, "features.txt"),header = FALSE)

#Read activity labels data
activityLabels = read.table(file.path(pathdata, "activity_labels.txt"),header = FALSE)

#Create Sanity and Column Values to the Train Data
colnames(xtrain) = features[,2]
colnames(ytrain) = "activityId"
colnames(subject_train) = "subjectId"

#Create Sanity and column values to the test data

colnames(ytest) = "activityId"
colnames(subject_test) = "subjectId"

#Create sanity check for the activity labels value
colnames(activityLabels) <- c('activityId','activityType')

#Merging the train and test data (VIP Step)
mrg_train = cbind(ytrain, subject_train, xtrain)
mrg_test = cbind(ytest, subject_test, xtest)

#Create the main data table merging both table tables

#The last step is to write the ouput to a text file
